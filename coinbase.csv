It will say this when you buy. Then after payment it's inflated by another 4 cents or more. High fees!! Like sky high. Also lots of coincidences that surround withdrawing. Signal always I mean always lost when your trying to cash out. I believe coinbase is a scheme. They also put old data on the cost of a certain coin. So when you buy or sell you lose alot of money due to coinbase controlling information and timing its release just right.
